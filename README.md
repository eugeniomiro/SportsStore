# SportsStore

## ASP.NET MVC 3.0 Course Application

This project was taken from Steven Sanderson and Adam Freeman [book](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-MVC-3-Framework/dp/1430234040) and continue its evolution ... if anyone wants to participate... :)

## Links and comments from within the application code

This is a collection of links found in the generated code which I wanted to remove from there but not to lose.
